This repository hosts the code and data supporting the SunGEO tutorial at [link]

If you would like to run the tutorial code locally (on your own computer), make sure to:
- Install [r](https://www.r-project.org/) and [rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- Download the supporting data (in the "data" folder)
  -You won't need the GADM data (the notebooks will download it), but it can speed things up
- Download the code we walked through in the video (xxx will match the script used in video, xxx includes more detailed explanation of code not covered in video)



You can also open and run the code *in the cloud* :sunglasses: using the binder button below (note that the notebook will take ~10 minutes to launch)   
Once the application launches:   
- Select the rstudio button
- Open the desired notebook
